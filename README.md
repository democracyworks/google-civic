## Installation
    gem install google-civic

## Documentation

## Obtain your API Key
Make sure to obtain your API key from here [https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api)


## Usage Examples
    require 'google-civic'

    @client = GoogleCivic.new(:key => "abc123")

    #elections
    a = @client.elections
    a.elections.first # => #<Hashie::Mash electionDay="2013-06-06" id="2000" name="VIP Test Election">

    # Voter info
    b = @client.voter_info(2000, '1263 Pacific Ave. Kansas City KS')
    b.pollingLocations.first.address # => #<Hashie::Mash city="Kansas City" line1="100 S 20th St" line2="" line3="" locationName="National Guard Armory" state="KS" zip="66102 ">

    # Voter info with backoff retries (up to 6 calls, 2 second pause between each, see below)
    b = @client.voter_info(2000, '1263 Pacific Ave. Kansas City KS', {connection: {retry: {max: 5, interval: 2}}})

## Backoff Retries
All of the client methods now take an optional `:connection` hash in the options. These options
will be passed through to the connection. Additionally, options under a `:retry` symbol key will trigger
the use of backoff retries. You can use the following retry parameters:

* `:max` - the maximum number of retries (default: 2)
* `:interval` - the pause in seconds between retries (default: 0)
* `:interval_randomness` - the maximum random interval amount expressed as a float between 0 and 1 in addition to the interval (default: 0)
* `:max_interval` - an upper limit for the interval (default: Float::MAX)
* `:backoff_factor` - the amount to multiply each successive retry's interval amount by in order to provide backoff (default: 1)

The retries are triggered by use of a customized exception and config for the Faraday::Request::Retry middleware. As such, use of the `:exceptions` is not allowed, use of `:methods` isn't needed (all the requests to the API are GET), and use of `:retry_if` might work but hasn't been tested.
